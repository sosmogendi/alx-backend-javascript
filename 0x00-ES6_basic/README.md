# ES6 Basics Project

This project is designed to help you learn the basics of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, which is a major update to the JavaScript language specification. It covers various features introduced in ES6, including arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, string templating, block-scoped variables, object creation, and iterators.
