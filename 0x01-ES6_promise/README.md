# ES6 Promises Project
This project demonstrates the usage of ES6 Promises, async/await, and error handling in JavaScript.

## Overview
In this project, we explore various concepts related to asynchronous programming in JavaScript using ES6 Promises. We cover the basics of Promises, including how to create them, chain them using `then` and `catch`, and handle errors gracefully. Additionally, we delve into advanced topics such as async/await syntax for writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous manner.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Promises: Learn what Promises are, why they are used, and how to create and consume them in JavaScript.
- Using `then` and `catch`: Learn how to handle asynchronous operations using the `then` and `catch` methods of Promise instances.
- Async/Await: Understand how to use the `async` and `await` keywords to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style.
- Error Handling: Learn how to handle errors in asynchronous code using try/catch blocks and the `catch` method of Promises.

## Requirements
- **NodeJS 12.11.x**: Ensure that you have NodeJS version 12.11.x installed on your system.
- **Text Editors**: You can use any of the following text editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
- **File Structure**: All your JavaScript files should end with the `.js` extension.
- **Testing**: Your code will be tested using Jest, and you can run the tests using the command `npm run test`.
- **Linting**: Your code will be verified against ESLint, so ensure that your code follows the ESLint rules.
- **Exports**: All of your functions must be exported from their respective files.
